# Internet Speed Test
I have awful internet and wanted to test just how bad it is, so I made a simple test to check it every 10 minutes, using Shell scripting for some reason.
Version 2 will be in python and have a nice dashboard to display just how bad it is, also a logging feature.
Needs speedtest.[net] CLI program to work, also ping but thats typically already on systems.
If ping [icmp] is blocked by your firewall you will need to allow it.
